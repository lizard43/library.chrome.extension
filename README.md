# library.chrome.extension
Chrome extension for searching library for highlighted/selected words

* Clone/download repo
* Load via settings menu, More Tools -> Extensions. Then "Load Unpacked Extension"
* Highlight word(s) in webpage, right-click and select menu item "Search Library for ..."

- My library has separate websites for books and ebooks so I open separate Chrome tabs for each. Remove the eBook URL and chrome.tabs.create lines if your library doesn't have separate sites.
